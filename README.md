To-Do List App
A self-contained, responsive To-Do List application built in a single HTML file using vanilla JavaScript, with persistent storage via browser localStorage and quick text filtering for efficient task management.

Features
Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks with an intuitive UI; no external dependencies or build tools required for usage.

Automatic persistence using browser localStorage so tasks remain available across sessions and reloads, ensuring data longevity on the same device.

Fast inline search/filter to quickly narrow down tasks by text, improving productivity with larger lists.

Inline CSS and JS bundled inside the HTML for zero-setup portability; open the file in any modern browser and start working instantly.

Getting started
Quick start: Open the file todo-list-app.html directly in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) and begin adding tasks immediately.

Optional local server:

Python: run python -m http.server from the folder and navigate to http://localhost:8000/todo-list-app.html for local hosting convenience.

No installation steps, builds, or package managers are needed due to the single-file design.

Usage
Add a task: Enter task text in the input and submit to create a new item; it saves to localStorage automatically.

Mark complete: Use the provided control (e.g., a checkbox/toggle) to mark tasks done, changing visual style and persisting state.

Edit: Update task text using the built-in edit action to correct or refine items without leaving the page.

Delete: Remove a task permanently with the delete button; storage updates instantly to reflect changes.

Search/filter: Type into the search field to show only tasks that match the entered text, enabling quick retrieval.

Project structure
todo-list-app.html — single-file app containing:

<style>: responsive UI styles, container design, and component states for a polished look.[1]
<script>: all logic for CRUD operations, filtering, and localStorage persistence in vanilla JavaScript.[1]
Markup: header, input controls, search box, and task list elements to compose the interface.

Data model
Storage: A JSON array of task objects saved under a localStorage key, ensuring data persists across page loads on the same browser/device.

Typical shape: Each task contains text and completion status; identifiers may be used internally to manage updates and deletions efficiently.

Compatibility
Runs in modern browsers that support localStorage and standard DOM APIs without requiring polyfills or transpilation steps.

No external libraries, frameworks, or bundlers (e.g., React, Vue, Bootstrap, Tailwind) are required, keeping the footprint minimal.

Limitations
Data is device- and browser-local; there is no backend or cloud sync by default, so tasks do not roam between devices automatically.

Not shipped as a PWA; there is no service worker or web app manifest in the current version for installability, though the app works offline once opened.

Drag-and-drop sorting and advanced metadata (e.g., due dates, priorities) are not included in this version to maintain simplicity and speed.

Extending the app
Add filters for status (All, Active, Completed) and advanced fields like priority or due date for richer task management.

Implement drag-and-drop ordering using the HTML5 DnD API or a lightweight helper library to customize task order.

Introduce export/import to JSON for moving tasks between browsers or backing up data safely.

Convert to a PWA by adding a service worker and a web app manifest for installability and robust offline behavior.

Development notes
Title: “To-Do List App” as defined in the page head for consistent tab labeling.

The single HTML file includes inline CSS and JavaScript, approximately several hundred lines combined for a fully self-contained application.
